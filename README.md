## Devlog
Looking first at the Player section of my plan, I did add a Collider and a Rigidbody to the Player GameObject in Unity. For jumping, I added in the Update method of the player code an if statement that checked for a space bar input for the player and if the player was grounded. If the player presses space, the AddForce method from the player's rigidbody is used to make the player object jump in game. For collecting coins, I added an OnTriggerEnter2D method as the coin would be the only trigger possible in the game. Once triggered, the player would up its _points variable and then proceed to update the points text itself as opposed to having a separate class for it like shown in my plan. For my coin spawner, all I had to do was to instantiate a coin prefab, which I had made when I had set up the other in game objects, at random times. To do this, I put the Instantiate coin method within an if statement which checked if a certain number between 0 and 1200 was selected from the Random.Range method I had put before the if statement. As this MakeCoin method was being run through Update, I had to make it a bigger number as the number would be checked for every frame, meaning I had to lower the chances of hitting the number by a lot. Finally, for the coins, in a new class, I just used their transform to use the Translate method to keep them constantly moving left once the were Instantiated in. In addition to this, to make sure they were "collected" by the player, I added an OnTriggerEnter2D method that made the coin destroy itself when it was triggered by something.
